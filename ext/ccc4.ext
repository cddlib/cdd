*Input File:ccc4.ine   (   7  x    7)
*HyperplaneOrder: LexMin
*AdjacencyTest: Combinatorial
*Degeneracy preknowledge for computation: None (possible degeneracy)
*Hull computation is chosen.
*Computation starts     at Wed Feb  2 10:21:27 1994
*            terminates at Wed Feb  2 10:21:27 1994
*Total processor time = 0 seconds
*                     = 0 hour 0 min 0 sec
*Since hull computation is chosen, the output is a minimal inequality system
*FINAL RESULT:
*Number of Facets =      12
